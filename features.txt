Swag (static website a generator) should:

# feel like a lightweight CMS
# use the file system without any config files, if possible
# support layouts, to easily separate
 - header (logo, simple nav menu, etc.)
 - sidebar (archive, latest flickr pictures, goodreads reading list, etc.)
 - footer (about, links, contact, etc.)
# blog features
 - automatic pagination of posts
 - RSS/Atom feeds?
 - comments through Disqus
# wiki features
 - footnote-style links (e.g. external references)
# code listings
 - syntax highlight (using pygments or something)
 - automatically add options such as "view raw" and "download"
 - on pages containing code, automatically add "download all code .zip"
