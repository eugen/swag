My name is Eugen Anghel. I have graduated the [Faculty of Computer Science](http://www.info.uaic.ro) from A.I.Cuza University, Ia≈üi. For about 5 years I've been working as a .NET Developer, but in my spare time I also like to play around with other things, like Haskell, Ruby and the Arduino.

[Syntactic.org](http://syntactic.org) is my home page.
